      <h1>Hi everybody! This is my first time ever coding.</h1>
      <p>The only experience I have is from what we have done in the pre-work.</p>
      <h1>I'm from Columbus, Ohio</h1>
      <p>I've lived in and around Columbus my whole life.</p>
      <h1>My favorite hobbies are weightlifting, creating social media content, and when I get the chance boxing</h1>
      <p>I've been lifting weights for a few years now, and recently started an Instagram page that helps inform people about diet and exercise>
      <h1>I have no idea. Running a social media page or pages and working from home</h1>
      <p>Ideally I would like to work from home, and be self employed. However, I can see scenarios where not doing remote work would be enjoyable as well..</p>
      <h1>Gahanna, Ohio</h1>
      <p>I live about 15 minutes from campus, and have lived in Gahanna nearly my whole life.</p>
      <h1>I enjoy creating things. Especially digitally. </h1>
      <p>I don't know why, but I really enjoy creating things that I can publish on the internet. I also enjoy mentally challenging and stimulating activities and thought that this would be an ideal way to both challenge myself and create some form of digital content.</p>
